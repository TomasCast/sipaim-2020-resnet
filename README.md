# A ResNet is All You Need? Modeling A Strong Baseline for Detecting Referable Diabetic Retinopathy in Fundus Images

## Readme

This repository accompanies our SIPAIM 2022 article on referable diabetic retinopathy detection in fundus images using a ResNet-18 model.

You will find here a series of files and resources that might help you to train your own models under the same setting than ours, in an effort to improve the way we compare methods for this task. Hence, we provide you with:

* An ```.ini``` file with our partitions in training, validation and test based on multiple public databases. This includes a separation of the original EyePACS training set into training and validation. You can access the file in ```data_split/global_split.ini```.
* ```.csv``` files with our predictions in validation and test images. This includes the non-referable / referable DR probabilities for each of the images, that might be used for you e.g. to generate your own ROC curves. You will find both files within the ```results``` folder.
